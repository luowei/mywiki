Of course this belief roots in his trust of himself. You may have this experience. If someone trust himself ,he will have strong sense of control, no fear,no anxiety, no panic. He is in peace and ease everyday. His good mood easily bring him high efficiency and wonderful success. Even if he is in trouble sometimes, he’ll also be very positive and have a lot of methods to surmount his diffculties. Everybody likes to get along with happy birds. Thus he will have a lot of friends who will help each other and enjoy life happily together.</p> <p>The cornerstone(the base) of a harmonious family lies in trusting each other. The trust between husband and wife keeps the family from quarrelling and nagging. The sound relationship between husband and wife turns the home into a paradise on earth. Otherwise, there is no happiness in his life. At the same time,if he trust his children,they will share their happiness and sadness with him. He is a good friend of his children,therefore he will naturally guide them with his experience. Furthermore, trust between his parents and he will also bring an enjoyable life of both of them.</p> <p>Finally, in our society trust is the base. Trust between friends will make one’s life easier and happier. He will share many things with his friends,get reasonable advice from his friends and take the priceless help from his friends. If he build up mutual trust with his co-workers, he will enjoy his work more. Additionally, the mutual trust between the emplyers and the employees will be very helpful to promote the efficiency of a company and an institution. Surely, the relationship between and individual and government are also based on trust. Because an individual belives that the goverment is justice and fair,he obey the regulations and law. An individual belives that the government cares his interests, help the weak, the poor and the kind, bans the viciousness, so he will have a good sleep everynigh.</p> <p>In a word(conclusion), if one want to have a happy and sunshine life, he should trust himself,his family members and his society. So if he is good at setting up trust with other people or the society, he will be the sunshine of the society.</p> <p><strong>朗读</strong></p> <audio controls="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luowei/mywiki/gh-pages/medias/Trust is the Gold.m4a"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. </audio> <h3 id="常用连词">常用连词</h3> <p>另外：additionally, in addition, furthermore, moreover, besides, what is more<br /> 虽然：however,Nonetheless,nevertheless,even so,but,still,yet,though,in spite of that,despite that<br /> 当然：Certainly, Surely,of course<br /> 因此,于是：therefore,consequently,so,as a result,thus,accordingly<br /> 总之：All in all,In a conclusion,in a word,in short,in brief</p> <h2 id="模板">模板</h2> <p><strong>观点</strong><br /> Today’s teenagers are more active in taking part in social lief, more ready to voice their opiniouss on social and political phenomena and more confident in dealing with the outside world.
